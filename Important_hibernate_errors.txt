Important hibernate errors:

1) mapped by and join column should not come together.

2) Collection is always lazy by default, change that to eager if u use join fetch.

3) I can use multiple @Entity,@Table for same table student

4) mappedBy = "other class java variable name";

5) mappedBy mostly used along with OneToMany,OneToOne
   
5) @JoinColumn(name="db name mostly FK")
