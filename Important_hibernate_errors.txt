Important hibernate errors:

0) Always remember in hib mappings(1->*,*->1,1->1,*->*),to map java variables with join on condition column

1) mapped by and join column should not come together.

2) Collection is always lazy by default, change that to eager if u use join fetch.

3) I can use multiple @Entity,@Table for same table student[TESTED]
  @Entity @Table("student")
  public class Student{/* dont forget to create some id*/}

  @Entity @Table("student")
  public class Stud {/* dont forget to create some id*/}
4) mappedBy = "other class java variable name";

5) mappedBy mostly used along with OneToMany,OneToOne
   
6) @JoinColumn(name="db name mostly FK")

7) @JoinColumn is used along with OneToOne,ManyToOne (remember MOJO JO JO )

8) ToOne is simply Object; private Student student;

9) ToMany is always collection; private Set<Student> students = new HashSet<>();
